footfoot

an update of aFoot. 

The big change here is making the visuals more useful to performance. Now you can see where, on the tape, material has been recorded, or at least when you have pressed record. 
There is also an indication of the preservation of the recorded material. Now it is very easy to see which tracks have material and when they might play again, 
thanks to the play head indicators.

There are a few other bits of functionality added/moved, in an attempt to make the script more useable from the norns, without relying on a foot controller. 
It still needs a few tweaks in that regard. But overall it works great and got me through a performance, and many rehearsals.
